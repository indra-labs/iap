1. **Abstract**

1. **Specification**

   This documentation provides the document format guidelines and procedures for moving the proposal through its life cycle.

   ### Document Protocol

   The IAP document must be written using standard Github flavoured Markdown, and optionally, if relevant, embedded graph and charts, as can be used in MD editors like Typora, the one used to compose this document.

   #### Fields of an IAP

   The sections of the IAP and their brief descriptions follow:

   1. **Preamble** - Metadata for the IAP, containing the following fields:
      1. **Title** - A short description of the proposal that refers to the key concepts of the proposal.
      2. **Author** - name or pseudonym, optional contact method. This can be superseded by adding a Maintainer field if the original or current Author/Maintainer passes the responsibility on.
      3. **Comments-Summary** - presence and brief description of comments.
      4. **Comments-URI** URI where they can be added (as PR, presumably).
      5. **Status** - draft, proposed, active, inactive, final, superseded
      6. **Type** - What this relates to, e.g.:
         1. IAP process
         2. Peer application
         3. Protocol
         4. Operations
      7. **Created** - Date of first upload.
      8. **License** - Redistribution license for IAP.
      9. **Replaces** - If this IAP supersedes a prior IAP, give the IAP number.

   1. **Abstract** - A paragraph or two describing the subject matter of the IAP.

   1. **Copyright** - More detailed info related to the License in the Preamble.

   1. **Specification** - Detailed description of the syntax, semantics, and architecture of the augmentation.

   1. **Motivation** - What is the reason for this augmentation?

   1. **Rationale** - Why the concrete solution proposed in this IAP was chosen.

   1. **Backwards Compatibility** - Address concerns related to breaking changes and/or ways to avoid this.

   1. **Reference Implementation** - Before an IAP is able to be marked "Final" it must 

   The above text can be copied as is to form the template, just remove the descriptions and replace with the content.

   #### Lifecycle

   The Status field of the document contains the status of the IAP, proposed, active, inactive, final, obsolete and superseded.

   The decisions about the status of the IAP are made by the quorum of actively interested and participating community and developer members, and for the time being authorised only by active members who are sacrificing their time towards the development of Indra. Non-involved parties may comment and propose but do not decide or arbitrate any stage of the lifecycle.

1. **Motivation**

   In order to open up the protocol to become a public utility, it must be open to the participation of the public in defining its operation at all levels. Thus, in keeping with the traditions of RFC and BIP we intend to make Indra also a public property and leaderless, as far as possible.

1. **Rationale**

   It worked for the Internet, and Bitcoin, that is enough.

1. **Backwards Compatibility**

   N/A

1. **Reference Implementation** 

   This document is essentially the Reference Implementation for this type of IAP.
